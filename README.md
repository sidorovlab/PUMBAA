PUMBAA is a MATLAB-based graphical user interface created by Devante Kerr in the Sidorov Lab in the Center for Neuroscience Research at Children's National Hospital. PUMBAA enables phenotyping using a multidimensional behavioral analysis algorithm. Given a rodent behavioral dataset with two genotypes and multiple behaviors, PUMBAA uses multidimensional analysis (principal component analysis + k-means clustering) to predict the genotype of animals based on their behavior.
